# Hi, I'm Rodrigo Marchese 👋

I'm a fullstack Software Engineer who loves making products—especially the kind that automate everyday tasks and put a smile on someone's face.

- 🧑‍💻 **Main stack:** Node.js, TypeScript, React, React Native, Java, Kotlin
- 🤖 **Into AI & Bots:** Currently tinkering with AI-powered WhatsApp bots (ask me about them!)
- ⚽🏑 **Team player:** Big fan of football and field hockey—love the teamwork on and off the field
- 🚀 **Product-minded:** I get excited about building real solutions that people actually use

What drew me into this field? The potential for tech to make life easier, better, or just more fun. Whether it’s shipping a slick frontend, wrangling backend logic, or dreaming up the next cool automation, I’m all about products that help people.

I’m always up for connecting with fellow devs, product folks, or anyone who loves building things. Got an idea for a collab, or just want to chat about bots or sports? Hit me up!
